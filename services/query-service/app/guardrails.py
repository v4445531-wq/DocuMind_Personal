"""Input guardrails.

DocuMind has two layers of defence against the model misbehaving:

  1. Grounded-only answering (in ask_service): if retrieval finds nothing, we
     return a fixed sentinel and NEVER call the LLM — it can't hallucinate from
     an empty context. This is the strongest guard and it already exists.

  2. Prompt-injection screening (here): a cheap heuristic that flags inputs
     trying to override the system prompt ("ignore previous instructions",
     "reveal your system prompt", "you are now …"). Flagged inputs get a fixed
     refusal instead of reaching retrieval or the LLM.

Heuristics are deliberately simple and explainable. They are a first filter, not
a complete defence — a stronger setup adds output checks and an LLM-based
classifier (noted in docs/ai/guardrails.md).
